AI Instructor Assistant

Developed an AI Agent designed to assist instructors in the creation and organization of educational materials, enabling faster and more efficient course preparation and delivery. The system intelligently generates lesson plans, course outlines, and exercise programs, adapting its recommendations to the subject matter, target audience, and instructional goals. By analyzing existing content, learning objectives, and educational standards, the agent ensures that every resource it produces is coherent, aligned, and pedagogically sound. Beyond simple content generation, the agent supports instructors throughout the teaching lifecycle by suggesting supplementary materials, assessment strategies, and interactive learning activities. It can tailor resources for different skill levels, learning styles, and teaching environments, promoting both consistency and creativity in course design. The result is a powerful instructional companion that reduces preparation time, enhances the quality of educational content, and empowers educators to focus on student engagement and learning outcomes.

Deep Research

Developed a team of AI Agents designed to autonomously research user-defined topics and generate comprehensive, well-structured reports in Markdown format. Upon receiving a research request, the agents coordinate to gather and analyze information from trusted sources, synthesize key findings, and produce a concise yet thorough report complete with citations, summaries, and relevant insights. The system ensures that each output maintains clarity, factual accuracy, and logical organization, making it immediately usable for documentation, presentations, or further analysis. Once the report is generated, the process continues with automated email delivery, sending the finalized Markdown document directly to the user for review or integration into existing workflows. The agents are capable of adapting their research depth and style to different domains — from technical and scientific subjects to market and business intelligence — ensuring flexibility across use cases. This seamless automation of research, reporting, and delivery streamlines the information-gathering process, saving users time while maintaining a high standard of analytical quality and reliability.

Financial Advisor and Agent Dashboard

An autonomous multi-agent trading platform designed to research markets, analyze opportunities, and execute trades intelligently. The system is led by a manager agent that orchestrates operations across a team of specialized AI agents. A dedicated research agent gathers market intelligence through web searches and real-time data collection on companies of interest, while four trader agents independently manage and balance their portfolios based on the research provided. Each trading decision and rebalancing action is logged, with push notifications keeping users informed in real time. All agents operate with decision-making autonomy and adaptive learning capabilities, enabling the system to continuously refine its strategies and deliver data-driven investment insights.

Document Proofreader

AI Agent Team designed to autonomously review and analyze written documents, providing comprehensive and actionable feedback. The system consists of a coordinated group of specialized agents that collaboratively assess a document from multiple perspectives to ensure quality, accuracy, and coherence. Its core functions include grammar and spelling verification, factual validation through source tracing, and semantic consistency checks to confirm that the content aligns with the intended subject matter and context. Beyond simple proofreading, the agents evaluate the logical flow, tone, and structural integrity of the text, identifying potential inconsistencies or gaps in reasoning. By leveraging natural language processing and knowledge retrieval models, the system can cross-reference statements against trusted external sources to verify factual accuracy.
